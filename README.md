Standardized Architecture for Heterogeneous Interoperability of Simulations (SAHISim) is a framework built on the basis of High Level Architecture (HLA) and the Fucntional Mock-up Interface (FMI). Any simulation component conforming to FMI or HLA can use this framework to orcehstrate a distributed simulation.
